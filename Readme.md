# ARKit In Practice

These is the resulting playground of my talk at [Swift Paris](https://www.meetup.com/swiftparis/events/243703627/).

To play around with it, airdrop the `ARKit In Practice.playgroundbook` to you iPad running iOS 11 with Swift Playgrounds installed and it will automatically open.

Unfortunely Playground Books aren't compatible with the current version of XCode.
