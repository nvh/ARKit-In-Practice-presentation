# ARKit In Practice

These is the resulting playground of my talks at [Swift Paris](https://www.meetup.com/swiftparis/events/243703627/), [Mobile Warsaw](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Warsaw/events/248993962/) and [CodeMobile 2018](http://www.codemobile.co.uk).

To play around with it, airdrop the `ARKit In Practice.playgroundbook` to you iPad running iOS 11 with Swift Playgrounds installed and it will automatically open.

Unfortunely Playground Books aren't compatible with the current version of XCode.
